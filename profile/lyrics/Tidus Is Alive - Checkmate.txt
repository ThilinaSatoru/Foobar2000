Here comes the war
here comes the fight
It seems we've never found another compromise

troops are deployed
mine against yours
there's no going back
It's time to settle the score

But she knows my moves
She always reads my mind
one step ahead of me 
most of the time

and that's what happens when you flirt with danger but I could not stop
a mix of beauty with a pinch of madness ,the recipe to tear me apart

[CHORUS]

Cause I'm a pawn and she's more like a queen 
She brings me down in just one move so easily
I can be hers but she'll never be mine
I must admit it maybe that is what I like


It's an handicap match
she's got me so bad
I'm facing my end
there's nothing I could pretend

Give up the game and then run away
I'd better step off she 's nothing that I could train


Cause she knows my moves
She always reads my mind
one step ahead of me 
most of the time

Everyone told me that I'll never be safe and sound
She always finds a way to turn my walls around

This is gonna be my end right now

This black and white floor is the place of all her strategies
then it turns to my grave
The cold look in her eyes never change
my fall is her aim

[CHORUS]

Cause I'm a pawn and she's more like a queen 
She brings me down in just one move so easily
I can be hers but she'll never be mine
I must admit it maybe that is what I like

End of the game she' s calling checkmate
All my rooks are falling down and all the knights are just turning around

[CHORUS]
