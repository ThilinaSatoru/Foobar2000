There's a place you still don't know
Where I saved a secret song

You had the time of my life

I've never had a real chance
to let you hear what I had

You had the time of my whole life

Do you ever think of me at night?
Cause I do it all the time
Do you ever think of me at night?

There's a place you didn't see
where I saved a melody

You had the time of my life

Moments gone by
But they're still inside

You had the time of my whole life

Here's the song I wanted to sing you to sleep and make you dream
here's the chorus it goes like this

I don't mind if you don't mind too
that's the place for me and you
unlock the door and see what's left behind
when everything's seems so unsure
I'll be the one you can count on
I'll always be with you no matter what
if you'll be my for ever girl

I found a sense in all the days 
when we were not so far away

you had the time of my life

Cause you're the muse that now inpires all the music that I write

you had the time of my fucking life

Do you ever think of me at night?
Cause I do it all the time
Do you ever think of at night?

I don't mind if you don't mind too
that's the place for me and you
unlock the door and see what's left behind
when everything's seems so unsure
I'll be the one you can count on
I'll always be with you no matter what
if you'll be my for ever girl

I think you have a part of me that I'll never get back
Will I be able to fill the void you left inside of me?
A mark which remains for eternity

But I'm looking forward I'm running from the past
But there's a part of me that I'll never get back
I'm looking forward I'm running from the past
but there's a part of me that I'll never get back

I don't mind if you don't mind too
that's the place for me and you
unlock the door and see what's left behind
when everything's seems so unsure
I'll be the one you can count on
I'll always be with you no matter what
